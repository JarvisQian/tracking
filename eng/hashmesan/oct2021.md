| 10/21 | Apple requested we create a demo video to show all the features on the devices and how the integration work.  Setup cameras, lighting from top down, to record the screen well.; annotated the video with iMovie and submitted them the video                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 8     |
| 10/22 | Apple approved the app; shared with internal group;  There were two major issues 1) the OTP on iOS15 going to System (which doesn't work), and 2) Dark mode which I wasnt aware about; continue research OTP options -- iOS15 do not support HOTP and Apple hijacked the otpauth:// url; luckily GA implemented oauth-migration which they receive directly.  We just have to implement protobuf encoding to make it work.;   Improved hashing rate 10X by spinning 5 threads, and reducing hash depth; | 8     |
